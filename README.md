####How to setup CMake GUI to build the WinRT Projects

Since CMake cannot create WinRT project files directly, the following procedure is required if you want to make changes to the opencv projects using CMake options. The basic procedure is:

* Set up CMake with the correct parameters
* Configure, Generate and Build Win32 projects
* Set up CMake for WinRT
* Configure and Generate WinRT project files
* Build WinRT projects

#####4. Click on Configure
#####5. Click on Generate

This will generate all of the files needed to build the Win32 open_cv projects in ```opencv\bin```. Open the ```opencv\bin``` directory and open the ```OpenCV.sln```. Build all of the projects. They should build without errors.

#####6. Return to Cmake Gui and enable the following option:

* ENABLE_WINRT_MODE	// Make sure this option is on
* Click on Configure
* Click on Generate

This will generate all of the files needed to build the open_cv projects in opencv\binWinRT

#####7. Open the ```opencv\binWinRT``` directory and run the ```convertprojects.ps1``` script. The script will create the WinRT projects in the ```opencv\binWinRT``` directory. The WP8 projects will be in ```opencv\binWP8```.


* open the binWinRT folder
* build the opencv.sln using VS2013


* open the binWP8 folder
* build the opencv.sln using VS2012 or VS2013
